					<h1>About</h1>
						<p class="is-size-5-tablet"><b>PhinDing Answers</b> is a podcast about the postdoc experience co-created by postdoc survivors <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olaya-fernandez-gayol/" target'"_blank">Olaya Fern√°ndez Gayol</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/psmyers/" target'"_blank">Peter Myers</a>. Our goal is to explore the experiences of different people who are going or have gone throught a postdoc and find out what is it that a postdoc can mean for one's career.</p>
						<p class="is-size-5-tablet"> Each episode contains an interview with one of our <a href="https://olayafg.github.io/phindinganswers/#guests" target'"_blank">guests</a> and is framed around these five main questions (with lots of derivatives!): </p>
						<p class="is-size-5-tablet"> 
							<ul>
							  <li>WHAT is a postdoc?</li>
							  <li>WHAT does a postdoc do?</li>
							  <li>WHO is a postdoc?</li>
							  <li>WHEN to do a postdoc?</li>
							  <li>WHERE to do a postdoc?</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p class="is-size-5-tablet">
						We've tried to cover different experiences by talking to people from different institutions and in different career stages and with different goals:
							<ul>
							  <li>Current postdoc with academic goals (Dr. Kaela Singleton)</li>
							  <li>Current postdoc with non-academic goals (Dr. Upasana Roy)</li>
							  <li>Former postdoc with an academic position (Dr. Serena Tucci)</li>
							  <li>Former postdoc with a non-academic position (Dr. Jenny Bratburd)</li>
							  <li>Postdoc Office administrator (Dr. Ericka Peterson)</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
